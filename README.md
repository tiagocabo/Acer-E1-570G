# Acer-E1-570G

In order to refurbish my 5yrs old acer I decided to install the newwest version of ubuntu and make a general cleaning and thermal paste replacement. Ifixit considered this operation dificult for a similar model. 

## Ubuntu 20.04 LTS instalation
I performed the change from Windows to Ubuntu using a USB stick flashed using etcher. Full details in the links below.

## Thermal paste replacements
Since the ifixit link does not cover my laptop model, I covered my replacement in the next pictures.
